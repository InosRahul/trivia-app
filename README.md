Trivia Game Technical Specification
Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications for a real-time, multiplayer trivia game built with Next.js (frontend), Golang (backend), WebSockets (real-time communication), and either PostgreSQL or MySQL (database). The game enables users to create and join rooms, answer trivia questions, and compete for points.
Functionalities
User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in using their email address and password.
Room Creation and Joining: A user can create a room and others can join using a unique room code.
Real-time Question Display: All players in a room see the same question simultaneously.
Answer Submission and Scoring: Players submit answers within a 40-second time limit. The fastest correct answer receives the most points, with subsequent correct answers receiving fewer points.
Player and Score Display: A panel displays connected players' usernames and scores in real-time.
Question and Answer Display: A central panel displays the current question and blanks for answer input.
Answer Feedback: The answer panel displays the player's guess and indicates whether it was correct.
Technologies
Frontend: Next.js for building the user interface and managing client-side interactions.
Backend: Golang for server-side logic, API endpoints, and WebSocket handling.
Real-time Communication: WebSockets for enabling bi-directional communication between clients and the server, ensuring instant updates.
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for persistent storage of user data, rooms, questions, and scores.
Architecture
Frontend (Next.js):
Handles user interface rendering, user interactions, and communication with the backend API via HTTP requests and WebSockets.
Implements three main panels: Player list, Question display, and Answer input/feedback.
Utilizes a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Context API) to maintain application state and update the UI dynamically.
Backend (Golang):
Provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, room management, and question retrieval.
Implements WebSocket server for real-time communication with clients, broadcasting questions, answers, and scores.
Manages game logic, including scoring, timer functionality, and question rotation.
Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL):
Stores user data (email, password), room information, questions, and player scores.
Implementation Steps
Project Setup:
Create a new Next.js project.
Initialize a Golang project for the backend.
Set up the chosen database and configure connections.
Backend Development:
Develop Golang API endpoints for user registration, login, room creation, joining, and question retrieval.
Implement WebSocket server functionality to handle client connections, broadcast messages, and manage game state.
Design database schema and implement data access logic.
Frontend Development:
Build UI components for the three panels (player list, question display, answer input/feedback).
Implement user authentication flow (signup, login).
Develop room creation and joining features.
Integrate WebSocket communication to receive real-time updates from the server.
Handle user input and display feedback based on answer correctness.
Integration and Testing:
Connect the frontend to the backend API and WebSocket server.
Thorough testing of all functionalities, including user authentication, room management, real-time updates, and game logic.
Deployment:
Deploy the Next.js frontend and Golang backend to a suitable hosting platform.
Configure the database connection and ensure proper security measures are in place.
Additional Considerations
Security: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data validation to protect against security vulnerabilities.
Scalability: Consider using scalable infrastructure and technologies to handle increasing numbers of users and concurrent games.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues and provide informative feedback to users.
User Experience: Focus on creating an intuitive and engaging user interface with clear instructions and feedback.
Next Steps
With the technical specifications defined, the next step is to proceed with the implementation phase, starting with the backend development in Golang. This involves building the API endpoints, WebSocket server, and database interaction logic as outlined in the implementation steps.
