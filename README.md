# Trivia Game Technical Specification

## Overview
The Trivia Game is a web-based multiplayer game where users can create or join rooms to play trivia. The game will feature real-time communication between players, scoring system, and a timer for each question. The application will be built using Next.js for the frontend, Go for the backend, WebSockets for real-time communication, and PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database.

## Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
  - Users should be able to sign up with an email and password.
  - Users should be able to log in with their credentials.

2. **Room Creation and Joining**
  - Users should be able to create a new room.
  - Users should be able to join an existing room.
  - Each room should have a unique identifier (ID).

3. **Trivia Game**
  - The game should load a set of trivia questions from the database.
  - Each question should have a timer of 40 seconds.
  - If no player answers within the time limit, the game should move to the next question.
  - Players should be able to type their answers in a text input field.
  - The first player to submit the correct answer should receive the most points.
  - The game should display the correct answer after the timer runs out or a player answers correctly.

4. **User Interface**
  - The UI should have three panels:
    1. **Player List Panel**: Display a list of connected players and their scores.
    2. **Question Panel**: Display the current trivia question and blanks `{_}` for the answer.
    3. **Answer Panel**: Provide a text input field for players to submit their answers.
  - When a player submits the correct answer, the UI should display "{player} guessed the correct answer."
  - When a player submits an incorrect answer, the UI should display the player's input.

5. **Real-time Communication**
  - The application should use WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients.
  - The server should broadcast game updates (e.g., new questions, player answers, scores) to all connected clients in the same room.

6. **Database**
  - The application should use PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database.
  - The database should store user information, room data, and trivia questions.

## Architecture
1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
  - Implement the user interface using React and Next.js.
  - Establish WebSocket connection with the backend for real-time communication.
  - Handle user authentication and room creation/joining.
  - Display trivia questions, player list, and answer inputs.
  - Update the UI based on game events (e.g., new questions, player answers, scores).

2. **Backend (Go)**
  - Implement API endpoints for user authentication, room management, and game logic.
  - Manage WebSocket connections and broadcast game updates to connected clients.
  - Retrieve trivia questions from the database and manage game state.
  - Handle scoring and determine the winner based on player answers.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)**
  - Store user information (email, password, etc.).
  - Store room data (ID, participants, etc.).
  - Store trivia questions and answers.

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up the project structure and dependencies for Next.js, Go, and the chosen database.
2. Implement user authentication (sign up and login) on the frontend and backend.
3. Create the room creation and joining functionality on the frontend and backend.
4. Implement the trivia game logic on the backend, including question retrieval, scoring, and game state management.
5. Set up WebSocket connections between the frontend and backend for real-time communication.
6. Develop the user interface components for the player list, question display, and answer input.
7. Integrate the game logic with the frontend by handling WebSocket events and updating the UI accordingly.
8. Test the application thoroughly, including user authentication, room management, game flow, and real-time communication.
9. Deploy the application to a production environment.

## Conclusion
This technical specification outlines the requirements, architecture, and implementation steps for building a Trivia Game web application using Next.js, Go, WebSockets, and PostgreSQL or MySQL. The application will provide a multiplayer trivia experience with real-time communication, scoring system, and a user-friendly interface.
